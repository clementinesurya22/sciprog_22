This is Practical 2


For this exercise I create Conversion.c and Sum.c codes

For Conversion.c code:
1. Compile and the program.
2. We notice that the floating point and integer presentations do not give the correct result.
3. We also would like to see how many binary digits are there in the number and how many can a float/real represent.
4. Let’s say we want to check the number of binary digits. Construct an expression in the code
that will do this.
5. I use the function logf in C, which is part of the maths library.


For Sum.c code:
1. Complete the code to make the sum 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + · · · + 1/1000
2. Print out the difference between the two sums.
3. We would like to see whether there is a difference between sum1 and sum2 and the two sums are mathematically the same or not.
