This is Practical 10

In this practical, I write a function that prints on screen the sequence of moves required to solve the puzzle for any
given number n. 

The logic is as per below:
If you want to move n discs from rod 1 to rod 3, using rod 2 as an intermediary,
the problem can be split into the following;
1. If n = 1, then we simply need to move the disc from rod 1 to rod 3.
2. If n > 1, then we want to move n − 1 discs from rod 1 to rod 2 (using rod 3 as an intermedi-
ary), which leaves disc n alone on rod 1. Move that disc from rod 1 to rod 3. Finally, move
the n − 1 discs from rod 2 to rod 3, using rod 1 as an intermediary.
