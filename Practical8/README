This is Practical 8

In this practical, we concentrate on recursive functions.

We write a function that returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of a pair of integers passed as
arguments. The GCD of two or more non-zero integers, is the largest positive integer that divides
the numbers without a remainder. We use the pseudo code to construct an iterative function and construct 
a recursive function to do the same, using the formula below the pseudo code.
