This is Practical 7

In this practical, for finde.c code, we use the Taylor expansion formula to estimate the value of e by setting x = 1. 
The user inputs the orderof the polynomial needed, dynamically allocate an array of type double which stores the the
term for each power of x separately and then Compare the estimate against the true value.


Next, we also create dynamicAllocation.c where we:
1. Write a function allocatearray() that takes an integer as an argument and returns a
pointer to an allocated memory block of that many integers.
2. Write a function fillwithones() that takes a pointer to an array of integers and fills every
cell of the array with a one. What other argument do you need to pass to this function?
3. Write a function printarray() that takes a pointer to an array of integers and prints its
elements on screen.
4. Write a function to free the allocated memory.
5. Call all these functions into a main block. Run with different array sizes.
