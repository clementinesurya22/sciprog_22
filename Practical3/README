This is Practical 3

In this Practical, there are 2 codes, which are use_printf.c and Trap.c

Description for use_printf.c:
It is used to display information on the screen. It will print variable r − values as they
are in memory at the moment when the statement is executed. The basic syntax for printf is
printf(format,variable1,variable2,...);

The number and type of each variable must match those in the format. Each %# corresponds to a
variable, with # determining the variable type. Spaces and punctuation appear as written as they
appear.


Description for Trap.c:
1. I am computing the area under the curve of f (x) where x ∈ [a, b] can be done using the Trapezodial
rule where x0 = a and xN = b with N − 1 equidistant points between a and b.
2. The integral is changed into a sum, using the values of the function at certain points. Increasing
the number of points increases the accuracy.
3. Find the integral of f (x) = tan(x) from 0 → π/3 and compare with the actual result log(2).
