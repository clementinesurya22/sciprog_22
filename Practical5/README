This is Practical 5

There are 3 codes for Practical 5 and below are the descriptions.

Description for use_scanf.c:
Programs can accept user input from the screen using, scanf 
• The first thing to notice is that for scanf the addresses of the variables are passed because we
want to bring information out of the function.
• The formatting descriptors are the same as those for print f , e.g. %d.
• However in this case the descriptors define how much space is reserved for the variable. 
Thus, we need to use of %lf in the format for long float or double.
• The scanf function returns the number of values it has read in, this can be tested.

Description for fibonacci.c:
Create a program that displays the Fibonacci series upto n
1. Get the user to enter the value of n.
2. Have a function that that has two arguments. On input the arguments have Fn−1 and Fn−2.
On exit they have Fn and Fn−1.
3. Use a loop to find the whole series upto n.
4. Print out the series.

Description for arctan.c:
1. Get the user in enter a real positive number delta.
2. Implement a function artanh1(x) as an approximation to this Maclaurin series. As the series
is infinite, we will set the function to stop when the element in the series is smaller than a
given precision, delta.
3. Implement function artanh2(x) using approximations to natural logarithms. 
4. Write a main that will calculate arctanh(x) where x ∈ [−0.9, 0.9] and sampled every 0.01,
using both methods. Store the results for both methods in separate arrays.
5. Compare the accuracy of each method with each other (to 10 significant figures).
