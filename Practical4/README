This is Practical 4

In this Practical:
• We calculate the values of tan(x) where x is in radians in the range [0, 60] every five degrees. 
Place the results in an array. Print the array. Make the array a global variable.
    1. Use the function (or subroutine) from the third practical, to convert degrees to radians.
    2. Construct main, in main have a loop where the loop counter does 0, 1, 2 · · · 12.
    3. Use the loop counter to generate the degree angles.
    4. Use the function to generate the radian values.
    5. Compute tan(x), store in the array.
• Create a function/subroutine that calculates the area under the curve of tan(x) from 0 → 60
degrees using the Trapezoidal Rule.
• There should be one argument, the number of points, and the return value is the area.
